# MeleeRevamp
This mod is still in beta test. 
TODO:
1. Optimize the state machine structure (remove redundant variables and structures to make it more readable)
2. Add more attacking moves as states
3. Rework the 4 materials of Nights Edge and some other starter melee swords
4. Look into the revamp of starter spears to make them throwable
